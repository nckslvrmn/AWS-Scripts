# AWS-Scripts

A collection of random AWS scripts that could be useful.

# Setup & Use

All the scripts in this repository use the latest python3 and assume that you
are passing in AWS credential information via environment variables or AWS
config file defaults. If you have many AWS credential sets in your config files,
specify `AWS_PROFILE=profile` when running any command. Additionally, all
scripts use the same `requirements.txt` in the root of the repository. Every
script has its own readme which documents its purpose and input syntax.
